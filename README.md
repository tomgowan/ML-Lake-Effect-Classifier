I wrote this script for a side project. It trains a deep neural net on  ~10 years of labeled radar images of lake-effect precipitation off Lake Ontario. The labels are the mode of the lake-effect precipitation. This deep neural net classifier may be used in future studies on the impact of lake-effect mode on precipitation distribution. It allows for the lake-effect precipitation to be classified as one of 6 modes and has an accuracy of ~90%.
